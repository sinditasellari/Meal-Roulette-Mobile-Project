I was having troubles running your already-created setup.
Hence, I created my own setup in Expo Go and then for/after the build in Expo Dev Client.
I hope this will be appreciated equally.

## Tech Stack

- React Native
- Expo

## Getting started - Run the commands inside task directory

```

npm install # install dependencies

npm run start # start app

npm run test # run the tests

```
## App demo

A compiled version of the app for Android can be found in "output" directory of repo.
